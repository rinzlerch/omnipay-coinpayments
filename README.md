# Omnipay: CoinPayments

**CoinPayments driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[Omnipay](https://github.com/omnipay/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements CoinPayments support for Omnipay.

Package originally based on InkedCurtis, however the original has gone from GitHub, so we have reuploaded it.

    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:
